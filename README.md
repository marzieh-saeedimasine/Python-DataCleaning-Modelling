Python Data Cleaning and Machine Learning modelling Repo:  

This repository provides a guide for data cleaning and machine learning modelling of different datasets using python.  

**Overview of data cleaning project:  
1-Downlaod wind power dataset form kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/theforcecoder/wind-power-forecasting  
2-drop_duplicate  
3-select important features (using corrolation function)   
4-handel missing values (using interpolate function)   
5-normalize data wtih MinMaxScaler() function  
6-data modelling with regression modellings
