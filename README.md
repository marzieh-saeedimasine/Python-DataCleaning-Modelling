Python Data Cleaning and Machine Learning modelling Repo:

This repository provides a guide for data cleaning and machine learning modelling of different datasets using python.



## Overview of data cleaning project:
'''
Downlaod wind power dataset form kaggle:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/theforcecoder/wind-power-forecasting
